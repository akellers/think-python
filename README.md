# Think Python

This repository serves as companion to the book "Think Python". It
works als playground to gain first experiences with the Python
programming languages.

To do so, I'll use Emacs Org-mode to establish some kind of 'literal
programming'. *(And I'm fully aware that there things like IPython an
Jupyter notebooks ;-)*
